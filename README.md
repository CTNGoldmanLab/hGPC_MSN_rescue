## **Abstract**
Neonatal glial replacement can delay disease progression in mouse models of Huntington’s disease (HD), in which glial dysfunction is a prominent feature. Here we asked if transplanting healthy human glial progenitors (hGPCs) into adult R6/2 HD mice might ameliorate phenotype, while concurrently investigating the diseased host’s neuronal response to wild-type glial engraftment. We found that the introduction of hGPCs into the striata of adult R6/2 HD mice indeed delayed their motor and cognitive decline, while extending survival. Single nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that whereas neuronal genes associated with synaptogenesis and synaptic structure were differentially down-regulated in R6/2 striatal neurons, the transcription of these genes was relatively rescued by wild-type glial engraftment. Retrograde rabies labeling of striatal MSNs then revealed that while both dendritic complexity and dendritic spine density were deficient in R6/2 mice, each was largely restored in hGPC-engrafted R6/2 mice. Together, these findings suggest that glial replacement in HD leads to a partial normalization of neuronal gene expression, which is associated with both a restoration of dendritic structural complexity, and a delay in disease progression.
